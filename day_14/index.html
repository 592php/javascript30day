    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let a = 'aaa'
    let b = a
    console.log(a, b) // aaa aaa
    a = 'bbb'
    console.log(a, b) // bbb aaa
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']
    let players1 = players
    console.log(players, 'players')
    console.log(players1, 'players1')
    // players.push('terry')
    // console.log(players, 'players') // 都增加了terry
    // console.log(players1, 'players1') // 都增加了terry
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    let players2 = players.slice()
    // players.push('terry')
    // console.log(players, 'players')
    // console.log(players2, 'players2') // copy出来的数组没有变化
    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    let players3 = [].concat(players)
    // players.push('terry')
    // console.log(players, 'players')
    // console.log(players3, 'players3') // copy出来的也没变化
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    let players4 = [...players] // ...展开运算符

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    let obj = {
      name: 'terry',
      id: '1',
      like: {
        eat: '吃',
        play: '玩'
      }
    }
    // and think we make a copy:
    let obj2 = Object.assign({}, obj) // 浅拷贝
    let obj4 = { ...obj
    } // 浅拷贝
    obj2.like.game = '666'
    let obj3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)) // 深拷贝
    obj3.like.game = '999'
    obj4.like.pic = '0000'
    console.log(obj)
    console.log(obj3)
    console.log(obj4)

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
